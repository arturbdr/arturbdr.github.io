## Senior Software Architect
**GoodHabitz** | July 2022 - Present | Eindhoven, North Brabant, Netherlands Â· Hybrid

I'm leading the transformation of our monolithic .NET 6 application into a microservices architecture using Node, Kotlin and .NET (8), while migrating our infrastructure and applications from on-premises to the cloud (GCP). The idea behind the migration is to make the systems easier to deploy, evolve, maintain, and scale.

### Technical Work

- Building core services with Kotlin (Spring Boot) and Node.js (Nest.js), and developing additional microservices with .NET (8)
- Migrating applications and infrastructure from on-premises servers to GCP cloud services
- Working with PostgreSQL and SQLServer databases
- Setting up Docker and Kubernetes for deployments, all microservices (Kotlin, Node.js, and .NET) generate Docker images
- Building applications with Gradle (Kotlin), npm (Node.js), NuGet (.NET), and managing version control with GitLab/Git
- Setting up and managing pipelines in GitLab CI and GitHub Actions
- Unit tests with JUnit, Mockito (Kotlin), xUnit, Moq (.NET), and Jest (Node.js)
- Integration tests across all platforms with Testcontainers and WireMock
- Using Logback (Kotlin), Serilog (.NET), and Winston (Node.js) for logging, with Grafana and Datadog for system observability
- Using SonarQube for static code analysis and improving code quality
- Developed an LTI 1.3 integration in .NET 8 to enable Learning Management Systems (LMS) to connect with our content while following IMS Global standards
- Applied the Strangler pattern to gradually phase out the old application

### Team Contributions

- Helping junior developers grow through mentoring
- Writing and updating coding guidelines to standardize the team's practices
- Supporting the team in maintaining high code standards
