## Senior Software Engineer/Senior Software Architect

**GoodHabitz** | July 2022 - Present | Eindhoven, North Brabant, Netherlands Â· Hybrid

I'm leading the transformation of our monolithic .NET 6 application into a microservices architecture using Node, Kotlin
and .NET (8), while migrating our infrastructure and applications from on-premises to the cloud (GCP). The idea behind
the migration is to make the systems easier to deploy, evolve, maintain, and scale.

### Technical Work

- Building core services with Kotlin (Spring Boot) and Node.js (Nest.js), and developing additional microservices with
  .NET (8)
- Migrating applications and infrastructure from on-premises servers to GCP cloud services
- Working with PostgreSQL and SQLServer databases
- Setting up Docker and Kubernetes for deployments, all microservices (Kotlin, Node.js, and .NET) generate Docker images
- Building applications with Gradle (Kotlin), npm (Node.js), NuGet (.NET), and managing version control with GitLab/Git
- Setting up and managing pipelines in GitLab CI and GitHub Actions
- Unit tests with JUnit, Mockito (Kotlin), xUnit, Moq (.NET), and Jest (Node.js)
- Integration tests across all platforms with Testcontainers and WireMock
- Using Logback (Kotlin), Serilog (.NET), and Winston (Node.js) for logging, with Grafana and Datadog for system
  observability
- Using SonarQube for static code analysis and improving code quality
- Developed an LTI 1.3 integration in .NET 8 to enable Learning Management Systems (LMS) to connect with our content
  while following IMS Global standards
- Applied the Strangler pattern to gradually phase out the old application

### Team Contributions

- Helping junior developers grow through mentoring
- Writing and updating coding guidelines to standardize the team's practices
- Supporting the team in maintaining high code standards

## Principal Engineer & Software Consultant

**Jumbo** | August 2018 - July 2022 | Netherlands

As a Principal Engineer, I led the design and implementation of new services, defined system architecture, and supported
developers by sharing knowledge and best practices. I managed the migration of a Java 7 monolithic application running
on-premises to a microservices architecture in AWS, applying the strangler pattern. This also included migrating the
database from MySQL on-premises to AuroraDB on AWS. Additionally, I contributed to the development of a new product
called Jumbo Extra, where I designed the backend architecture. I also helped the team adopt Clean Architecture
principles, sharing knowledge and promoting best practices in code design.

### Technical Work

- Developing microservices using Spring Boot and Spring Cloud
- Setting up messaging systems with AWS SQS and SNS for service integration
- Managing database storage with MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and AuroraDB
- Using AWS Elasticache (Redis) for caching solutions
- Building and deploying services with Docker and Kubernetes
- Version control with Git and automating builds with Maven and Gradle
- Creating CI/CD pipelines in GitLab CI and GitHub Actions
- Writing unit and integration tests with Spring, JUnit, and Mockito, and performing stress testing with Gatling
- Logging with Logback and Logstash, sending logs to Datadog
- Monitoring and metrics collection with Spring Actuator and Datadog
- Analysing and improving code quality using SonarQube

### Team Contributions

- Mentoring developers and sharing architectural knowledge to enhance team skills
- Defining and documenting patterns and practices to guide the transition to microservices
- Promoting Clean Architecture principles to improve code design and maintainability

### Role Progression

- Principal Engineer (July 2020 - July 2022)
- Software Consultant (August 2018 - July 2020)
