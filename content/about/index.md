Hi Lara!

I'm a Software Engineer with 17+ years of experience building systems that solve real-world problems and help businesses
grow. My work focuses on designing and implementing scalable architectures, leading technical teams, and guiding
organizations through complex technical changes.

I've spent much of my career modernizing legacy systems, moving from monoliths to microservices using approaches like
the Strangler Pattern and Event Sourcing. I'm also experienced in cloud platforms like AWS and GCP, where I've led
migrations that improved scalability and performance while staying cost-effective.

My technical expertise includes Java, Kotlin, and Node.js, but what I really enjoy is collaborating with teams and
stakeholders to solve tough technical challenges. I work to ensure that everyone (developers, product teams, and
business leaders) is aligned, so the solutions we create are practical, efficient, and built to last.

## Technical Expertise

- **Languages**: Java, Kotlin, Node.js, .NET
- **Frameworks**: Spring Boot, Nest.js
- **Cloud Platforms**: AWS, GCP
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, SQLServer, MySQL, Aurora (AWS), MongoDB
- **Event/Message Systems**: Kafka, SNS/SQS (AWS), Pub/Sub (GCP)
- **Storage**: S3 (AWS), Cloud Storage (GCP)
- **DevOps**: Docker, Kubernetes, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions
- **Monitoring**: Grafana, Datadog, New Relic, Logback
- **Quality**: SonarQube, JUnit, Mockito

## Key Focus Areas

### System Architecture

Designing systems that are scalable, maintainable, and aligned with business needs.

### Microservices

Breaking down monolithic applications into modular, adaptable systems.

### Cloud Platforms

Developing and migrating applications with an emphasis on performance, reliability, and cost reduction.

### Collaboration

Bridging the gap between technical and non-technical teams to achieve shared goals.

I believe that great solutions come from clear communication, practical trade-offs, and teamwork. If you're exploring
ways to improve your systems, modernize your architecture, or solve challenging problems, I'd love to connect and share
ideas.
