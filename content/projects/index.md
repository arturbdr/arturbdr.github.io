## Senior Software Architect
**GoodHabitz** | July 2022 - Present | Eindhoven, North Brabant, Netherlands Â· Hybrid

I'm leading the transformation of our monolithic C# framework into a modern microservices architecture using Node, Kotlin, and .NET (6 and 7), while migrating our infrastructure and applications from on-premises to the cloud (GCP). This change has made our systems easier to deploy, maintain, and scale.

**Technical Impact**

- Building core services with Kotlin, Node.js, and .NET (6 and 7)
- Creating microservices with Spring Boot, Nest.js, and .NET (6 and 7)
- Migrating applications and infrastructure from on-premises to GCP
- Working with PostgreSQL and SQLServer databases
- Setting up Docker and Kubernetes for deployments
- Managing builds and code with Gradle and Git
- Setting up automated pipelines in GitLab CI and GitHub Actions
- Writing tests with Spring, JUnit, and Mockito frameworks
- Using Logback, Grafana, and Datadog for system monitoring
- Using SonarQube to keep code quality high
- Built an LTI 1.3 integration in .NET 7, allowing Learning Management Systems (LMS) to connect with our content while following IMS Global standards

**Team Contributions**

- Helping junior developers grow through mentoring
- Creating and improving coding guidelines for consistent, high-quality code
- Supporting the team in maintaining high code standards
